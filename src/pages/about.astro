Hey! I'm Yunusov Abdulmajid, a backend developer based in Uzbekistan. 
I focus on building reliable APIs, Telegram bots, and deploying applications to live servers. 
Many of my projects are available on GitHub and deployed with custom domains for real-world testing.

My technical background includes Python, Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, and Aiogram. 
I work with databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite, and handle deployments using 
Docker, Nginx, Railway, Contabo, and Vercel. I also integrate services such as Google Sheets 
and Forms for automation workflows.

Some of my key projects include Telegram automation bots, an API monitoring dashboard, 
and custom APIs for audiobook and education platforms. These projects combine 
REST API design, background tasks, automation, and DevOps practices.

I studied backend development at PDP Academy (offline, completed 2024) and continue to learn 
through self-study on platforms like Mohirdev, Udemy, Coursera, and 42. 
Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the foundations of AI and Machine Learning.

Beyond coding, I enjoy technical writingâ€”Iâ€™ve published articles about Django and DRF 
on Medium â€” and I run the GoldenDevs community to share knowledge and collaborate with other developers.
